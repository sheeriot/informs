* always use the native asyncio and pytak way of doing things
* do not timeout and manually end connections that are should be under control of pytak and asyncio
* always ensure asyncio tasks are called in such a way to end naturally
* after queue is created, filled, run, then it becomes empty, reflect that in the log
* after queue is empty, it is time to close it, is that by existing the await so the asyncio loops are released?
* We let the native asyncio and pytak way of doing things handle the cleanup
* The code follows the principle of letting the framework handle its own lifecycle management, which is more reliable and follows the intended usage pattern.
