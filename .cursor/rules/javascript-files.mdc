# Your rule content

- use javascript provided data from the template to work with data
- for Aid Requests List page [aid_request_list.html](mdc:informs/webapp/aidrequests/templates/aidrequests/aid_request_list.html)
- the [aidrequests-filter.js](mdc:informs/webapp/static/js/aidrequests-filter.js) should manage filters and filter groups
-- should maintain counts by aid_type, priority, status intersectionally with other filters
- all or none or some priorities matches the all checkbox (checked, indeterminate '-', or unchecked)
- all or none or some aid_types matches the all checkbox (checked, indeterminate '-', or unchecked)
- status is broken into two groups, defined in the model
-- active_statuses
-- inactive_statues

- [aidrequests-list.js](mdc:informs/webapp/static/js/aidrequests-list.js) uses the data source read and managed by [aidrequests-filter.js](mdc:informs/webapp/static/js/aidrequests-filter.js) and the filterEvent and hides and shows in the aid request list (table)
- [map_aidrequests.js](mdc:informs/webapp/static/js/map_aidrequests.js) uses the same datasource, and the filterEvent and hides and shows data points in the aid request layer.
