# Javascript and Debugs

- keep the HTML variable names kebab-names and the javaScript using matching camelCase
- all javascript files should run logically from top to bottm with main a the top then functions in the order they are used

- In any included javascript file, always put console.logs on a conditional for xxConfig.debug
- do not use a function for logging. We want the line number retention
